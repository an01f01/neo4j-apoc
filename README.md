## Grab the APOC plugin
Download the APOC plugin for your Neo4j graph database from here:

https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/5/installation/

Make sure to download the matching first two versions of the plugin aligned with your database, such as if your Neo4J database is 4.4.31, then you grab the APOC library version 4.4.xx

Hope this helps!
